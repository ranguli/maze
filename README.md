# maze
_a maze game in <50 LOC. some things just aren't worth putting on github_

![wow](wow.png)

use the hjkl keys to move the `@` to the `$`. the game works with any maze you can make/generate so long as the collision detection is set to recognize the symbols (in this case `*`), and maze ends with a `$`.

to-do:
- add a turn counter to see how efficiently you can solve it
- add a basic maze solver AI
